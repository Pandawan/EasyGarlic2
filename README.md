# Discontinued

Sorry, this project is now discontinued. I found out that reporting information between nodejs/electron and the gpu is a very big task that I am currently unable to work on.
If you have experience in this, please submit a PR and I might get back to working on this.
There are just so many different possibilities with the different devices and platforms and I don't see this happening for the time being.

# EasyGarlic v2

GUI Miner for Garlicoin.
This is a total rewrite using Electron and React instead of C#'s WPF, allowing it to be cross-platform and easier to maintain.
